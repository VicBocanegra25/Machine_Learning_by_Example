Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group and Ken Hollis posts a compressed version of the shuttle manifest dates and other periodically The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE archive in The portion of his manifest formerly included in this FAQ has been please refer to his posting or the archived For the most up to date information on upcoming call at Kennedy Space Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks The Guidance and Flight Control Training ASC the vertical rise the launch pad attitude is commanded until an sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is the tilt maneuver orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative which in turn alleviates structural Other advantages with this attitude are performance decreased abort maneuver improved look and crew view of the The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff target in second This really is a good but couched in NASA try to We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere and the chord of the wings imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing is a slightly negative angle negative This causes a little bit of force the belly of the or the and this force structural We have to be careful about those wings about the most part of the The new attitude the also allows us to carry more mass to or to achieve a higher orbit with the same or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we roll The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort the Return To Launch Site abort maneuver The new attitude improves the ability for radio antennae to have a good signal with the radio antennae on the Orbiter look The new attitude allows the crew to see the which is a helpful not part of piloting any flying The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the and the nose to the east This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain This all begs the the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin Why does the Shuttle need to roll to achieve that The answer is that the pads were leftovers from the Apollo The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches one for the Solid Rocket Motor one for the Space Shuttle Main Engine can see the effects of this on any daytime The SRM exhaust is dirty gray and the SSME exhaust is fluffy white Watch for the difference between the and the Tank of the The access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the Saturn side the Saturn also had a roll ask me why a Shuttle I checked with a buddy in Ascent He added that the is really a maneuver in all three pitch and The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack within a tight The yaw component is used to determine the orbital The total maneuver is really expressed as a a concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one HOW TO RECEIVE

discussion about it a while In article Andrew proper term for what Mike expresses is This was a that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in It up in reaction to which held that the Son and Jesus two different people who happened to be united in the same body Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Then OFM comments issues get mighty When you see people saying different often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously or whether they are using different I think any question that there is a problem with and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form a real human nature or will is But like to be bit wary about the Recent discussions that their monophysite position may not be as far from as many had With my appreciation to the I believe that further elaboration is This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the Newsletter Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople opposed to the western empire of the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played leading roles in Christian They were invited everywhere to speak about the Christian Pope of was the head of the Ecumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year It was said that the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend all their time in This leading did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with Church It all started when the Emperor Marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the The response of the Pope of Alexandria who was later to this interference was have nothing to do with the These political motives became even more apparent in Chalcedon in when the Coptic Church was unfairly accused of following the teachings of who believed in This doctrine maintains that the Lord Jesus Christ has only one the not two the human as well as the The Coptic Church has never believed in monophysitism the way it was portrayed in the Council of In that monophysitism meant believing in one Copts believe that the Lord is perfect in His and He is perfect in His but His divinity and His humanity were united in one nature called nature of the incarnate which was reiterated by Cyril of believe in two natures and that are united in one without and without the declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine These two natures not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an from the declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine The Coptic Church was misunderstood in the century at the Council of Perhaps the Council understood the Church but they wanted to exile the to isolate it and to abolish the independent Despite all of the Coptic Church has remained very strict and steadfast in its Whether it was a conspiracy from the Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church as a punishment for its refusal to be politically or whether Pope Dioscurus quite go the extra mile to make the point that Copts are not the Coptic Church has always felt a mandate to reconcile differences between all Christian This is aptly expressed by the current successor of Pope Shenouda the Coptic faith is more important than and others must know that semantics and terminology are of little importance to Throughout this the Coptic Church has played an important role in the ecumenical The Coptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of It has remained a member of that council since The Coptic Church is a member of the all African Council of Churches and the Middle East Council of Churches The Church plays an important role in the Christian movement by conducting dialogues aiming at resolving the theological differences with the Greek and Evangelical As a final the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign a common statement of in which the heresey of Monophysitism was So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in Nabil Nabil Ayoub Engine Research Center of Mechanical Engineering University of I mentioned in a brief the comment quoted above from me is I appear to say that Nestorius was As Andrew Byler correctly stated the Nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite The point I was which Nabil explains in some is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably Chalcedon was a compromise between two the Alexandrians and It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both while ruling out the I agree that there were extremes that were However in the course of the complex politics of the it appears that some people got rejected who intend but simply used language that was not understood or even was And some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than There are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical This posting discussed the descendants of the There are also a remaining Like some of the current there is reason to believe that the current Nestorians are not heretical They sheltered Nestorius from

       " 'Andrew The Nicene Creed MAJOR VIEWS OF THE Civil Carnegie PA Michael Bushnell Creed of has always been a Western and has always had the The Orthodox have said that accept all that it with the exception of the but is not Which is exactly what I pointed I was wrong about your use of the the Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the Apparently that has The Athanasian Creed has always had the the Nicene Constantinopolitan did Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed there to begin but they certainly did from the Athanasian which did have it from the I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the and the West using proceeding from the Father and the In such as used both formulations the form of these I profess that I do call God and His the Father and and His For the root and the stem are two but the fountain and the river are two but the sun and the ray are two but coherent Anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it but it is not on that account separated from Where there is there are and where ther is there are The is third from God and the just as the third from the root is the fruit of the and third from the fountain is the stream from the and thrid from the sun is the apex of the Against and believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father through the Against And as Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part Question Articles and there is no contradiction between the two methods of and in the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what among others that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the but He proceeds from the Father in a more preeminent whatever the Son He has from the certainly He has it from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him For the Father alone is not from for which reason He alone is called in the but in the practice of and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so The is born of the and the Holy Spirit proceeds principally from the and since the Father gives to the Son all that He has without any interval of the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly from both Father and He would be called Son of the Father and of the Son which is abhorent to everyone of sound they had both begotten The Spirit was not begotten by but proceeds from each and Augustine of The to in a all of the formulations are correct the West at because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and but in proceeding from the the orgin of that procession is the procession from the so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through the but as all that the Son has is from the the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the without any mention of the Son being In any I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope Leo Fulgence of Cyril of Pope Damsus Augustine of Epiphanius of Ambrose of Hilary of and others among the who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic which I enunciated As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being I will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the Fathers of That Creed is a different Creed than that of which is commonly called the Nicene Not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the Constantinopolitan which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of but that they were condemning the impious opinions of who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the which among other things denied the procession of the Holy Spirit form the the additions of the Constantinopolitan Creed were not thought to be in violation of and as the Council Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the which Nestorius they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the for they themselves approved of previous additions to And if the further explanations of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way it follows that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians in because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until many years later under Photius and And that the filioque was not I provide more quotes the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to and he actually proceeds from the Father and it is abundantly clear that He is of the divine in it in essence and proceeding from Cyril of The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial Thesis Holy Spirit is not of the Father or of the Son but he is the Spirit of the Father and the For it is anyone loves the the Spirit of the Father is not in and again it is does not have the Spirit of he is none of When the Father and the Son are named in this the Holy Spirit is of whom the Son himself says in the that the Holy Spirit from the and that shall receive of mine and shall announce it to Damasus The Decree of Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the appelation of but is called Holy and is not foreign to the For the Himself calls Spirit of the and says of Him the proceeds from the and receive of so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the but is of their same of the same He is Spirit of and He is For he is Spirit of Spirit of the and Spirit of the not by some kind of like soul and body in but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father and of the a third by Father always existed and the Son always and the Spirit breathes from the Father and the and neither is the Son created nor is the Spirit Epiphanius of Salamis is on The Man and the Holy I ought not to remain nor yet is it necessary to on account of those who do not know it is not possible for me to be However it is necessary to speak of Him who must be who is from the Father and the His Hilary of The to as I have pointed out and the lands of the all of Christnedom at that all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church that they come up with some of the besides John of Damascus who all will admit denied the to support their It is not enough to bring up the

general quality of argument found is This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to in the hope of improving the general level of Logic is the science of or inference Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not or Of one does not need to study logic in order to reason a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally The matter is very much open for This document merely explains how to use given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the Propositions are the building blocks of a logical A proposition is a statement which is either true or for is or is Propositions may be either asserted to be or denied to be Note that this is a technical meaning of not the everyday The proposition is the meaning of the not the particular arrangement of words used to express So and exists a both express the same An argument to quote the Monty Python connected series of statements to establish a definite An argument consists of three First of the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are These are called the premises of the They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its Premises are often indicated by phrases such as and so phrase is often viewed with as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious If something seem obvious to be afraid to question You can always say it is when heard the the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as In one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already There are various forms of valid The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further Inference is often denoted by phrases such as or we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as follows and so The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of For Every event has a cause The universe has a beginning All beginnings involve an event This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event Therefore the universe has a cause and Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular the terms do not make sense in Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given for the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the This is perfectly if sometimes a little Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an Some statements look like but are For the Bible is Jesus must either have been an evil or the Son of This is not an it is a conditional It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its also suffers from a number of other logical but come to those Another created therefore do your duty to The phrase your duty to is not a since it is neither true nor Therefore it is not a and the sentence is not an causality is Consider a statement of the form because If interested in establishing A and B is offered as the statement is an If trying to establish the truth of then it is not an it is an For must be something wrong with the engine of my because it will not This is an car will not start because there is something wrong with the This is an There are two traditional types of deductive and A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions that an argument where if the premises are the conclusion must also be A deductive argument is either valid or A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are then the conclusion is An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the Inductive arguments are not valid or we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other and about how probable their premises There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor we will concentrate for the moment on deductive as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion This is because of the slightly nature of which we must now consider more Obviously a valid argument can consist of true an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false For All insects have wings Woodlice are insects Therefore woodlice have wings the conclusion is not true because the premises are If the premises were the conclusion would be The argument is thus entirely More we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false as All fish live in the sea Dolphins are fish Therefore dolphins live in the sea the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true We can therefore draw up a for The symbol denotes is the the and represent true and false Premise Conclusion Inference A B F F T If the premises are false and the inference F T T the conclusion can be true or T F F If the premises are true and the conclusion the inference must be T T T If the premises are true and the inference the conclusion must be A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are A sound argument therefore arrives at a true Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an These pitfalls are known as In everyday English the term is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those This is fair but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect especially if the argument appears valid or So for the purposes of this we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by The following list of fallacies is not intended to be ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM TO The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a It is often used by and can be summarized as makes The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the For Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM Argumentum ad hominem is literally directed at the The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs instead of trying to disprove the truth of an the arguer attacks the person or people making the This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting For is an evil It is practised by Communists and Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by for that he is a known This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the and not argumentum ad it does not demonstrate that the testimony is To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam elsewhere in this The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the particular For is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for How can you argue otherwise when quite happy to wear leather This is an abusive charge of used as an excuse for dismissing the This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a For course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad This particular form of Argumentum ad when one alleges that adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish is also known as the ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM Argumentum ad ignorantium means from This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved a basic scientific course the Bible is Nobody can prove course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not Nobody has shown any proof that they are Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of where one is generally assumed innocent until proven in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not For flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the The earth does not have a tenth as much even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the Therefore no such flood In we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM This is the Appeal to also known as Special The fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion For did not murder my mother and father with an Please find me suffering enough through being an ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM This is known as Appealing to the or Appealing to the To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive For must be It is violence against Bible must be Millions of people know that it Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a the more likely it is that that proposition is ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an For Newton was a genius and he believed in This line of argument is not always completely for reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that For we can distinguish quite clearly Hawking has concluded that black holes give off and Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent Hawking is a and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be Searle is a so it is questionable whether he is to speak on the subject of machine THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose circumstances mean that the rule is It is the error made when one goes from the general to the For generally dislike You are a so you must dislike This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general CONVERSE ACCIDENT HASTY GENERALIZATION This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible For Bakker was an insincere Therefore all Christians are SWEEPING GENERALIZATION DICTO SIMPLICITER A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC These are known as False Cause The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the For took an aspirin and prayed to and my headache So God cured me of the The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the For Soviet Union collapsed after taking up Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter It asserts that because two events occur they must be causally and leaves no room for other factors that may be the of the PETITIO PRINCIPII This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid For must not be allowed to hold government Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their and will be open to Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government Note that the argument is entirely the premise is the same as the An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret official ban on homosexual Another example is the know that God exists because the Bible tells us And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of COMPLEX QUESTION FALLACY OF INTERROGATION This is the Fallacy of One example is the classic loaded you stopped beating your The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been This trick is often used by lawyers in when they ask questions did you hide the money you politicians often ask loaded questions such long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to or the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous IGNORATIO ELENCHI The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that For a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable EQUIVOCATION Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same For could be more affordable than free But to make sure that it remains that users can do what they like with we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely AMPHIBOLY Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical ACCENT Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting In this the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are For should not speak ILL of our and should not speak ill of our FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the For bicycle is made entirely of low mass and is therefore very The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those For car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than FALLACY OF DIVISION The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of Like its it exists in two The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its For are studying at a rich Therefore you must be The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each For can destroy a Therefore this ant can destroy a THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT This argument states that should one event so will other harmful There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first For we legalize then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and have a nation full of on Therefore we cannot legalize IS BASED ON FALLACIES A TYPE FALLACIES These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are history based upon If then the Bible also a form of is based on Christianity is based on so Islam a form of are a form of animal based on carbon dogs are a form of animal based on carbon so dogs a form of AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT This fallacy is an argument of the form implies B is therefore A is To understand why it is a examine the truth table for implication given DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT This fallacy is an argument of the form implies A is therefore B is the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro the latter has the form implies A is therefore B is where A does NOT in fact imply B at the problem is not that the implication is rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL This fallacy is an argument of the form A then therefore if B then ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is or because the way always ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM This is the opposite of the argumentum ad it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of that those with more money are more likely to be ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is An ad is one that employs constant repetition in asserting BIFURCATION Also referred to as the and bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two where in fact other alternatives exist or can PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM MANY QUESTIONS This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex NON SEQUITUR A is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with RED HERRING This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being so that attention is diverted away from the points being towards a different REIFICATION HYPOSTATIZATION Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or Shifting the burden of a special case of argumentum ad is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven STRAW MAN The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone position so that it can be attacked more then to knock down that misrepresented then to conclude that the original position has been It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been THE EXTENDED ANALOGY The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different in an argument about a general constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking a position is it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black How dare TU QUOQUE This is the famous It occurs when an action is

statehouse at It was looking sparse until the speaker whereupon about more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been and filled out the area something Mike Yacino of GOAL One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of to hold their Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the and telling people where to find their own representatives in too many who they Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that made it onto the official It seems a delegation of students from Rock of Bard College mater of Wayne who shot up the place with an SKS late last was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state The hearings were originally scheduled in the Gardner Auditorium at but that had been by the hearings on the Framingham Eight in prison for killing abusive and seeking So we had until to buttonhole our after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing One of my staffers was somewhat offensively He it must be gun hearings day The gun lobby is always so organized every I got a little and not from the gun lobby from your At your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse the Randy Price from the TV News was in his mirror reflective talking to one of the and several Rock Randy had covered the GOAL The room we had been assigned seated about there were about gun owners plus another students and teachers from One of us had already reserved a the other never got closer than the atrium outside and there was a crowd behind A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming Soon after the debate a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone Everyone who was there and got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which Most of us signed up to on because of their time public officials got to And first up was the bill that nobody had seen students had some I Massachusetts law allows a to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own the law was but applied only to from states adjoining The Rock folks called the current law a and wanted it Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his assault The second a had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana home with and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second from claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it but he was the new bill allows purchases by of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state strong that in Since none of them Some of the things these two said were really some of these other anyone can buy a gun as long as have some very good gun laws in if only the other states would adopt the same type of we be having this situation but they Next up was Boston city councilman Albert He was there to testify but in some ways he was a reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat plus almost a caricature of a He badmouthed the said violent criminals should be and that if he were give arrestees their on the spot which many of the gun owners which bothered He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction for the He said this FOUR times Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or and confiscate all your if someone had filed a restraining order against that the filing of a restraining order requires no no no and no conviction just an Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of and patronized the there several times by sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have I seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he a Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five instead of permanent as it is The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become has nothing to do with some congressmen think stupid enough to swallow the argument that preferable to process million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction As hassle the instead of the The two of the committee were Caron and Jujuga say much was a of both but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go was a of one of the bills as One of the younger reps on the committee his was vociferously somewhat embarrassingly His heart was in the right but his arguments seemed to be confined year the same damn you come in here with this nice to have a friend on the but he could have been more At about it was clear that the Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their so the loudspeaker was So they found a bigger hall One of us had to leave to catch his charter and so missed the the other got a seat this Caron began by talking about how he got his FID years left the and then returned without notifying them of his address He complained that the state record system was not and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived Great you purchase a gun it will not get into the state computer system until was also an argument he used against the renewable FID Testimony was heard from several one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his who had an FID card because he got it when he was or They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this saying how restraining orders were granted last and how these women needed to be Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the She gave some long rambling circumlocution in Then testimony against the bill was Mike Yacino looks something like got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right or and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his Other got up to One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her and that she countered by filing one against He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became One of the junior reps noted that is and we have to be certain that individual rights are Senator Jujuga reiterated saying that who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining and Another got up and testified that he know his citizenship every and that a license was a not a right like the right to keep and bear A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill and joking responded that favored public The speaker then make you a You get me the and tie the Next came public testimony on the Rock A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne and that have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was without his evil She said that the should be closed to prevent something like this from happening Four or five other kids testified in favor of this one of spilling tears for the good One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also Many of them had T shirts long as one person can buy a gun in none of us are safe support gun The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the except for who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an residents can get he much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut completely Yacino and McNutt spoke this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by Karen also noted that hunters in and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student even an as he had NO criminal or mental One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than and thought it was Another said that we need the protection of preventing from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had so complying with all the laws of home state was One speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and out of step but All the Bard College people were filing out as the testimony for this bill was and thus only were around when the other bills came under The main bills remaining o and four Notify police chiefs so they can pull licenses when a holder is convicted o Require trigger locks on all handguns sold o Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms o Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws o Fund vests for municipal police o State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA o Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards o Several altering license conditions o Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state Some of these took only seconds to as the remaining raised hands in unison either for or against Mike Yacino noted besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were Caron blew right through when he saw that we opposed he brought up the archaic records capability and would create hundreds of different

innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent Tell me what are these guerillas doing Assuming that they are using civilians for come If we are going to get anywhere in this it help to bring up elements I never commented on in any I made no comment on who is or who is only that civilians ARE being used as cover and having been placed the Israelis and the they be injured as both parties continue their of an use of military uniforms is set its members from the civilians so that civilians will not be thought of by the other side as what do you think is the the intention and the effect when an purposely not were uniforms but goes out of its way to like are judging that the benefit they will receive from this is more important that the harm that will come to This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas have some responsibility in putting civilians in of this By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to But if the guerillas do this putting themselves at greater they ask themselves set ourselves apart wearing when there is a cover for us That makes sense from their point of BUT when this cover is the guerillas should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on is it not Why is it further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer You there is more to the shelling of the it is called It make sense to shell the The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of I agree with you I have always thought that bombing sortees and bombing policy is inhumane AND there is no reason that Israel should passive wait until attackers chose to there is every reason to believe that the fight the will do more to stop As I said Israel spent several decades on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks the attackers had entered Israeli It work very The Arab state did to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states can start all over While I also hope for this to it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their They have to Prove it provide some there is no way Israel is going to accept their not with their past attitude of tolerance towards guerillas If Israel is not willing to accept the of others it has no business wasting time coming to the peace This is just another The reason for this impasse between and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the By your criteria should stay away from the That is precisely why the Palestinians their recent PISGA proposal for the period after negotiations and leading up to full are demanding conditions that essentially define They DO NOT trust that Israel will the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the If you then why should view of be any Why should they trust the Since they they are VERY reluctant to give up assets control of in exchange for For this they are also concerned about the sorts of they will have that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement you see that the same statement can be made both Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the will remove the cause for its continued so are the asking FIRST for the Israelis in relation to any what is being demanded FIRST is When the issue is and one party finally gets HOLD of this what the does is totally If I NOW have possession of this your words have absolutely no whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from it occupied in Lebanon during you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been Hezbollah remains the only independent Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh his and young While the allowing people to wage have been the weapons needed to attacks still remain to some Rocket attacks still and raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life of that of Such attacks also Of if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they make the Lebanese so mad as to do Bat The situation you call for existed in the and attacks were with Hezbollah subsequently it would not be There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with essentially mirroring border secirity on its It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian Not what I that mean that Syria has to I think Israel or Lebanon would like What both need is to receive something The Palestinians are looking for and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to

seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of realizing the to is a of an innocent person by shooting at random into the and is a of killing an innocent person when the administers a system of capital So when you do you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or result in the killing of an innocent but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of driving will kill as will but people continue to do and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling by They are risks that we take upon ourselves And I argue that our law system is a similar Perhaps an innocent person will be punished but we work to prevent In many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of our own driving kills someone then there is a moral I know at least one person who was involved in a fatal and they felt vey guilty such accidents are to be totally given the numner of vehicals on the the blame is on This is what you You were saying that if there were such false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed it would still be the fault of the since it did the actual I just commented that the state does the It does not on there being false How could The state the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes but the state is not at fault in such a The state can only do so much to prevent false is what are you trying to that capital punishment always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating saying capital punishment is Not because of that and the but because it involves taking human definition of I make no appeals to dictionaries to so this is what you call the question is whether or not all such are Are you saying that all taking of human life is no matter what the as a decide to murder then we should say and lists our reasons for doing and live with the moral We should not play word games and pretend that And opinion about how society to be this is basically how it Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by every member of society shares this most definitions of murder include some sort of malicious which is not involved in an is we were trying to discuss an objective moral or at least its What ramifications does your personal system have on an we were not discussing an objective moral I was showing that you have for one you were incapable defining the terms in for Murder violates the golden Executions do because by allowing it at society implicitly

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April Centers for Disease Control and Prevention MMWR Emerging Infectious Diseases MMWR Apr Introduction Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United Since the early the public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes Escherichia coli hepatitis C human immunodeficiency Legionnaires Lyme and toxic shock The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under such as and tuberculosis have increased in many control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as pneumococcal and staphylococcal infections Emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised those in institutional settings hospitals and child day care and minority and underserved The substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs This issue of MMWR introduces a new Infectious Future articles will address these as well as and prevention efforts by providers and public health This first article updates the ongoing investigation of an outbreak

Mycotic National Center for Infectious Editorial coli is a pathogenic bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers This pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and the most common cause of acute renal failure in Outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground although other food including roast raw and apple also have been implicated Preliminary data from a CDC multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for coli that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of participating hospitals and was isolated from of all bloody a higher rate than for any other Infection with coli often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April SMAC and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea and abdominal fever is Younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and Illness usually resolves after but of patients develop which is characterized by hemolytic renal and a death rate of This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of coli in the absence of routine Despite the magnitude of this the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for coli using SMAC agar When infections with coli are they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation if public health action to prevent further coli lives in the intestines of healthy and can contaminate meat during CDC is collaborating with the Department of Food Safety Inspection Service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as coli entering the meat Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the ground beef is likely to be internally The optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer and the juices are In this undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important The Food and Drug Administration has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to F personal Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by coli and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of coli References Preliminary foodborne outbreak

MMWR Apr Consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the United States almost tripled from through use of smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of oral cancer the incidence of which could increase if young persons who currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco National Health Interview Promotion and Disease Prevention supplement collected information on snuff and chewing tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to This report summarizes findings from this The supplement asked you used snuff at least times in your entire and you use snuff Similar questions were asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette Current users of smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco use at least times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the time of the former users were defined as those who reported having used snuff or chewing tobacco at least times and not using either at the time of the Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and former Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at least cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as those who reported having smoked at least cigarettes and who were not smoking Ever smokers included current and former Data on smokeless tobacco use were available for persons aged greater than or equal to years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide national Confidence intervals were calculated by using standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis In an estimated million adults were current users of smokeless including million men and For all categories of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was substantially higher among For the prevalence of use was highest among those aged years for the prevalence was highest among those aged greater than or equal to The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Natives and the prevalence among women was highest among American Natives and Among both men and prevalence of smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing Prevalence was substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in rural Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April men and women below the poverty this difference was significant only for women less than Among the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those aged years but varied considerably by the prevalence of use of chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group Although women rarely used smokeless the prevalence of snuff use was highest among those aged greater than or equal to An estimated million adults reported being former smokeless tobacco Among ever the proportion who were former smokeless tobacco users was Among persons aged the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users than among chewing tobacco users Among persons aged the proportion of former users was similar for snuff and chewing tobacco Among current users of smokeless currently formerly and never In among current were current users of smokeless Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users than among chewing tobacco users Reported Office on Smoking and National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Div of Health Interview National Center for Health Editorial The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco was highest among young Adolescent and young adult in are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and Use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine oral and other mouth disorders Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further For targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons In this one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke In the the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco users than among current and never smokeless tobacco In a previous study among college of current smokeless tobacco users smoked HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April occasionally In approximately of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking providers should recognize the potential health implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette The national health objectives for the year have established special population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco including males aged years no more than by the year objective and American Native youth no more than by the year objective Strategies to lower the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless tobacco integrating smoking and smokeless enforcing laws that restrict access to making excise taxes commensurate with those on encouraging providers to routinely provide cessation advice and providing prevention and cessation and adopting policies that prohibit tobacco use on school property

earlier Jewish The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of As you will main strategy is to take various Old Testament often not even about the promised and apply them to the circumstances in the New We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the Since the gospels were written at least years after Jesus was we do not know how much happened exactly as for purposes of we will take particular claims at face We of at the will bear a and will name him means is for he will save his people from their All this happened to fulfil what the lord had spoken by a In the days of Ahaz king of Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made war on Jerusalem of but could not quite conquer When the house of David Ahaz and his court in were told of heart and the heart of its people the lord said to to meet with the lord spoke to Ahaz prophet a sign of your It can be as deep as Sheol or as high as Ahaz I will not put

will eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil and choose before the child knows how to refuse evil and choose the land of the two kings you dread will have been Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in he the Hebrew word as this is not a prophecy about the It is not a prophecy about an event to happen years It is not a prophecy about a virgin In it not about Matthew has made use of a verse out of and tries to make it fit the specific case of It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general a very general it can be made to fit virgin or was indeed a young woman with Of the fit is shady and has while thought of by later Christians to be walking among was never called by the If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for it becomes at best a a second class Not too After birth in Matthew tells about a quick elsewhere excursion to as if he wishes to liken Jesus to This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the remained there until the death of This was to fulfil what the lord had of Egypt I have my What the lord really said was When Israel was a I loved out of Egypt I called my The more I called them the more they went from they kept sacrificing to the and kept burning incense to Matthew conveniently omits the rest of it was indeed Israel once called out of wanted to This is Jesus is certainly not being spoken of if we are to draw some kind of parallel we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had Rachel While Jesus is off vacationing in Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill and thus ordered the executions of all young male Matthew then By that which was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was voice was heard in wailing and loud Rachel weeping for her she refused to be because they were no The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon in the ancestor of the major tribes of and is said to weep for her descendants who are It is of since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian It is interesting to note that it was not who was the ancestor of the Judeans land where Jesus and Bethlehem If anyone should do weeping for her it is The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the the way to As for Herod and his it is rather unlikely that such an event actually One never but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the Herod was particularly unliked in his and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully This might be a prime example of how events were added to life to enhance the message of the Because of the whole similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add yet approval of It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah The the prophet speaks of are not but exiled in the Assyrian comforts the weeping saying that the children will be he will gather them back Of this would not suit as the children he speaks of are dead for the Matthew sets up is not even and to anyone who bothers to check it is not too The We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean After leaving Joseph wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of what was spoken of by the prophets might be shall be called a First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the this we have to ask who There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a there are no mentioning a Still there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at In the book of an angel tells mother that she and bear a No razor shall tough his for he will be a Nazirite to his god from the day of his He will deliver Israel from the hands of the This is of course not a prophecy of or the messiah of it is the best that can be Matthew has begun to go overboard in in that he is simple making them up Bearing our Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet took our infirmities and bore our As the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian We Surely suffering has borne our and carried our From a reading of the surrounding passages in we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of chosen servant and He speaks to the Israelites suffering in in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity image of a yet Israel as the instrument of the salvation by The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and They do not speak of a going around and healing Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations individual as we all did not take the diseases onto The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to but rather something that had already While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of he did not bear the illnesses he while someone might want to say Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual he has to admit that parallel misses where he intended it to have its Silent Upon healing multitudes of it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep presumable so that he arouse the attention of the local This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet my servant whom I have my with whom my soul is I will put my spirit on and he will announce justice to the He will not wrangle or cry nor will anyone hear his voice in the He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to and the gentiles will hope in his The Isaiah passage quoted Behold my servant whom I my in whom my soul I have put my spirit on and he will bring forth justice to the We will not cry or lift up his or make it heard in the He will not break a bruised or quench a smoldering He will faithfully bring forth He will not fail or be discouraged until he has established justice in the And the coastlands await his You Matthew has conveniently left out part of the because it does not suit the dealings of Christians could never think of Jesus never would the of mankind burn the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is When the gentiles come to embrace there will no longer be a chosen but rather all will be the children of the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic coastlands await his to the Gentiles will hope in his While the original proclaims the Torah law of the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of in the If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not one has only to read the whole Isaiah and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect people robbed and we see that when attempt at is it Three Days and Three Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus He speaks of his crucifixion and For as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three Before any further discussion can it is necessary to know how the Jews understood As far as day names each was hours lasting from sunset to the following sunset What was referred to as a was the period of light from to the ending sunset at according to our time a sabbath day began at Friday and lasted until saturday This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of instead of seems like a real miracle that Christians forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the when days and nights are referred to hour daylight portions and hour night periods are being spoken Jesus says that he will be in the or in or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three As the good book tells Jesus was crucified on the which is Friday He then was put into the grave sometime after Jesus left the before dawn of what we call Sunday dawn after the sabbath was What this means is that Jesus using our time for in the grave from Friday night to some time before Sunday We could also add a little time before since the bible is not specific What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one two and possibly a couple of hours of one Certainly this is a problem for Jesus There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights using modern time We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of little and that the gospel writer put false words into his And no matter who made the it is more than it is Hearing Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in stories in which a deeper meaning could be if you were already one of the those chosen to understand the message of He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he If the people cannot understand there is no need to bother with since they will not accept the message any Matthew With them indeed in fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which will indeed hear but never and you will indeed but never Because this heart has grown their ears are heavy of and they have shut their eyes so the they would not perceive with her with their and understand with their and turn for me to heal The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier his call to the This is in when Israel is right before it falls under the authority of Isaiah sees the good times and also a vision from calling him to bring reform to Israel and And and say to this and but do not see and but do not Make the heart of this people make their ears and shut their so they will not see with their or hear with their and understand with their and turn and be Then Isaiah And he the cities lie waste without and houses without and the land is utterly and the take men far and forsaken places are many in the And though a tenth will remain in it will be burned like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stands when the tree is The holy seed is its Here we see that it is really who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the but reaffirms the promise made to If you read the rest of you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of to use Israel as a a light to the at Isaiah We see that Matthew has just a little portion of to suit his own gospel More than he has altered the to make it fit the people who understand as we verses are not but rather commands from to in the Once prophecy falls flat on its Matthew tries again to make parables look like they have the prophetic said nothing to them without a This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the will open my mouth to them in I will utter that which has been hidden since the foundation of the Matthew really botches up He attempts to quote not from a but from the I will open my mouth in I will utter dark sayings of things that we all have heard and things that our fathers have told We will not hide them from their but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the As was pointed the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a You might also want to know that earlier copies of gospel even inserted name as this later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it Perhaps the most significant part of this is once Matthew has altered the Old Testament As Jesus has said he speaks in parables so that some will not understand The parables in the Psalms are not to be they speak of things that our fathers have told Jesus deals with things since the foundation of the Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and This is in direct opposition to the parables in the No wonder Matthew had to rewrite And still once artificial prophecies fall flat on their Christians rarely look at prophecies the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look Excuses of Little In we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out except in one Not knowing what epilepsy the people thought those with the disease were possesed with It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to the perhaps no more enlightened than is reported to have rebuked saying they have enough This seems Why was this demon It seems that either a

world that is is the compassion of human the love given and taken by men and the forgiveness practised by Christian Atheist beauty created by the mind of These are the things that are these are what we it is said this is so only because everybody has little Jesus Rides on an Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into This took place to fulfil what was spoken by the Tell the daughter of your king is coming to mounted on an and on a Of the passage quoted from Zechariah reads a little your king comes to he is triumphant and and riding on an on an he will command peace to the There all that much difference except that Zechariah only involves one animal while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult From we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two This could inevitably lead to a proctological We find that in the account written earlier by only the colt was called for and brought to This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic he has excluding many respectable Christians I have I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on the situation is often reversed entering the Jerusalem the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have you of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little things AND as we might the quote is in which seems to fit track record quite We might ask Jesus or you for the source O YaHWeH our how majestic is your name in the whole whose glory is chanted above the heavens by babes and you have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the enemy and the The passages hardly need There is no spoken of in the and what praise is there is given to not his messiah and not As it seems to be just one more case of pen making up convenient prophetic YHVH said to my Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish is to be The Jews it is king then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms LORD said to my sit at my right until I put your enemies under your Taken at face Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic One assumes he is in opposition to their Of the Christian answer is that he but is trying to make some hidden to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the tempting to believe if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of there are In the psalm was thought to be about the it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great bringing the Jews to times even better than those under Of the Jews listening had no good and the passage could indeed refer to a divine such as the Christians The problem lies in the meaning of this an error that apparently several Jews of time had also One must remember that there were various factions among the often as a result of different expectations of the Jesus was apparently one of these like his who thought the advent was and who interpreted Psalms among as being What is the Psalm literally utterance to my at my right until I make your enemies your YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Rule in the midst of your Your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy are a priest of the order of Melchizedek The word is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this in the the word is and no capitalisation Adoni simply means a generic term as we would use It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to It is merely an address of There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the That this is supposed to be written by David is not The title of the psalm translates to either psalm of or psalm about It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court about covenant and endorsement from If the psalm had been written by it is unlikely that he would be talking about the The idea of a perfect descended from was not present in We have extensive tales of doings and none of which include any praises of a Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was in times of the exile when had put his show of favour for kingdom on The description in the psalm fit David very David was promised by a rise to victory over his successful judgement among the nations he He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous enabled to bless the It all We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew there is not artificial prophecy alluded though his use of the scripture is rather this event is common to the other gospels we let Matthew off a little more easily this It is interesting to how Matthew dresses up the The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a Matthew has the who became the religious competition of an infant be the target of As we might Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Such power is the Moses Had it Together All We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a in The gospel story of John deserves special because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of career as told by even for the we will just look at one The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by When constructing the history of Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish While this was accomplished under the rule of king the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the to do they expanded on the preaching about a heavenly Your rejoiced to see My He say it and was It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a or anything I have and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to little It is par for the course to see John making up Old Testament just like his forerunner Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such and it is surprising they still cling to The We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his Judas Matthew And throwing down the pieces of silver in the the chief taking the lawful for us to put it in the since it is blood So bought a field with it to bury strangers Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet they took the thirty pieces of the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of and they gave them for the as the lord directed This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use they weighed out my thirty shekels of Then YHVH said to them to the lordly price at which I was paid off by So I took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of First of the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the or of The deal with a most likely a chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one The had been replaced by the King James Scholars with the precisely because this made quote fit this is a blatant The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed which also makes perfect sense in whereas is totally Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond given track one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional Of Matthew would have ample reason for altering the The thirty pieces of silver match and if as most Christians seem to the reader is willing to disregard the contextual Matthew might have another prophecy to toss the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high The high priests would not put the money in the The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the Of to the average Bible the as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face To work is convincing Casting Jesus is led away to be gave him vinegar to mingled with but when he tasted he would not drink when they had crucified they divided his garments among them by casting that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the parted my garments among and upon my vesture did they cast First of the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour of the type that Roman soldiers drank We find that right before Jesus the soldiers themselves give him some to drink polluted with A bowl of vinegar stood so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his When he had received the he is Matthew seems to be drawing not a passage from the but one from the I looked for but there was and for but I found They gave me poison for food they put gall in my and for my they gave me vinegar to Add to them punishment upon may they have no acquittal from Let them be blotted out of the Book of the Of the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of This does indeed seem to be a show of The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military It is not about the messiah or It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the in the psalm asks for the damnation of the whereas the Jesus of the gospels Jesus forgive the know what they Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall bitter put into not his as the psalm With the of the vinegar we naturally of the casting of This brings up the which deserves discussion all by Suffice it now to say that the fact that clothes were divided as told is no great It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those As we will soon it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of For a man so removed from worldly his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some The This psalm is attributed to as a lament of his condition under the attack of his It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of Taken out of parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite We will examine the primary Verse My my why have you forsaken Why are you so far from helping far from the words of my my I cry by but you and by but find no Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the This suggests that the whole psalm is really about rather than king Of the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole he is supposed to be like lamb led mute before its Jesus do much even when on the He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the I am a and no scorned by All who see me mock at They make faces and wag their committed his cause to So let him deliver for he delights in This seems to fit execution pretty with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a Many bulls encompass they open their mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring dogs are round about a company of evildoers they have pierced my hands and I can see all my They divide my garments among and cast lost for my But be not far my soul from the my life from the power of the Save me from the mouth of the and my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild It would seem quite and sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so this prophecy has a fatal The words really do not exist in the The correct Hebrew translation dogs are round about a company of evildoers encircles like the they are at my hands and In Hebrew the phrase the and a very rare verb form which can mean differ by one phonetic The word in the Hebrew text is the which makes sense in the and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to to add the needed weight to the this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to its absence does not say much for the honesty of the Apart from the erroneous verse the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so Verse speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a This naturally fits the true king As a side we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the the but rather the This say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his But facts bound by our religious Matthew escapes culpability this as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord But the like many was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of life and How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian It is easy to for those who are not faithful how some of the events in the New Testament might have been by scribes such as the eager it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic So this has not said good things for The reference to the piercing looks a lot like gospel written about years after the tells us at But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a and out came blood and these things took place that Scripture be will look on him whom Of this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with And YHVH will give victory to And on that I will seek to destroy the nations that come against Jerusalem And I will pour a spirit of compassion and on Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have they will and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that at usually excontexts more than just one errors are grossly obvious and blatant It does not speak well for any of the gospel as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were Reckoned with After his Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish According to one version of the gospel Jesus gets executed along with two And with him they crucified two one on his one on his And so the scripture was fulfilled which was reckoned with the Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah about the servant nation of The passage is not about the for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah and its surrounding one sees that the servant is a The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the not a prediction of what is to in any The servant is thought of as a This also happens to fit the description of Had the passage really been about the it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the in Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal at least in this as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general Mark goes on to tell us how who were crucified with also reviled This is to be expected from a couple of Of course in his later Luke decides to change some Luke tells And one of the criminals who was hanged with him you the Save and This certainly fits with which tells how the people who crucified Jesus and that the robbers did the But then Luke goes But the other rebuked you fear since you are under the same sentence of And indeed justly for we are receiving the due reward for our this man has done nothing And he remember me when you come in your And Jesus I say to today you will be with me in this little dialogue seems highly It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his Such a apparently noble and of seem likely to have been a We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Of recount also disagrees with Luke has only one criminal revile not It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of do not have this avenue This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his In this the embroidery creates some embarrassing as we have The End of the Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and and his disciples ask him about and about the end of the world which he has been warning The Tell when will this and what will be the sign of your and of the close of the Take care that no one leads you for many will come in my am the will hear of wars and rumours of for this must take but the end is not nation will rise against all this is but the beginning of the They will deliver you put you to and false prophets will arise and lead many he who endures to the end will be This gospel will be preached throughout the whole a testimony to the and then the end will when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet those who are in Judea flee to the Immediately after the tribulation of those the sun will be the stars will fall from then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in and all the tribes of the earth will and see the Son of Man and he will send out his and gather his Learn the lesson of the fig as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth you know that summer is So when you see all these you will know that He is at the very Truly I say to this generation will not pass away until all these things take of the day and no one not the not the but only the you also must be for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not From it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his He tells them that although he know the exact day or that it will and thus they must be Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Jesus made himself to He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the and that they in particular should prepare for prepare to be swept There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the and said that the generation shall not pass really means race of people will not pass Of the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly the generation of the It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn he learn it well enough to make himself it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples least some of are supposed to live to the End of the The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the It becomes abundantly clear from Peter John and that Jesus meant exactly what he The End was very For Christians have rationalised this chapter of or ignored its meaning For they have waited for their executed leader to come hearing of and rumours of sure that He is coming Surely He must All we must do is Can you imagine how tired He must sitting around up being waiting for just the right moment to shortly after his Jesus of It is said that after three or three days and three or three periods of or three eternal seconds three of whatever they can decide makes for less he was seen glowing with divine Then the Saviour decided it in the best interests of his new religion to stick and therefore disappeared from sight into So the story As has been there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories To Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and We have that this matter is quite throughout Church Christians have held fast to in simple What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute faith and forgetfulness kept away from To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat Thus for the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely Things may well continue that way for some Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used or to support wars and I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep think that I have come to bring peace on I come to bring but rather a',\n",

opinion on the do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his Although possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some thereby bursting I can no longer assume that to be the no Matthew did not say Judas died as a result of the did Most scholars believe he iprobably I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the but in looking at the texts we assume Judas It highly and there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or It simply means if you do further research as to the Greek word you will find that it does denote Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was As I pointed I recently checked several English Lexicon of the New Louw and Nida Greek and English Lexicon of the New English Lexicon of the New Grimm study Tynsdale Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian New Analytical Greek Perschbacher A couple simply stated and a couple were more explicit and stated that means specifically yourself by A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for is throttle or pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside One of the best references Greek and English Lexicon of the New not only stated the it gave both the root the literal related greek words which use the same and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature give further The word has two root is the and the root word means literally This root words is included in words which denote a It can mean a transition in place the greek word means to send a can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word which means In literal meaning the word means strangle to put out of the and implicitly denotes a change in life state away from to So while the word does mean it specifically denotes a death as Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means hang to end life by He then notes the the use of in Homers Odessy to denote He presents that example of as being used to explicitly mean by Now since there is a perfectly good word for without the added denotation of and as you insist that the Bible was written by and every word is precicely you are stuck with the complete meaning of Since the word was then death is denoted as the By the I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of In the Septuagint Greek translation of the OT used at the time of only used in Samuel when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not he saddled a and arose and went home to his to his Then he put his household in and hanged and and he was buried in his Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel but it explicitly Here we have no doubt of the In we are not explicitly told Judas Note Mr as you the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew the the Hebrew say and thus whether it was simply echoed in the It should also be pointed out regardless of the added the correct translation would still be as the man did indeed die from strangulation but we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited included versions which contradicted each and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now as a paragon of ancient what you really need to prove your point Mr is an in ancient of someone committing and Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding Now I would note Mr that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived I pretty much find it I think that if you are going to add to the something over and above what the source clearly then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify By the as to Mr statement about trees around the There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years or that there are year old stumps or has a thousand year old description of the area which mentions such then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago things Now as to your other that the money Judas used is not the same as the As to your second question Mr you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the was indeed for the rather than some other I would point out that in where it specifically mention reward of it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about Acts Judas who was guide to those who arrested Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of and then immediately discusses reward of it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one Notice that in verse the word is not it states that Judas a guide to those who arrested But the writer DID NOT stop he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this What part did Judas play in their Peter the author of does not specifically call betrayal but for that neither does John specifically call actions Further John did not say that Judas took the money but rather thought that Judas had the money Jesus was telling him what we need for the or that he should give something to the So after receiving the morsel he immediately went and it was Note that it is said that Judas it does not say that he took the money Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven mentioned by another in a different written at a different over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of I find this forced and Of course this particular argument becomes since we have have seen evidence that means You since hanging was he could not have spent the money mentioned in John because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next Thus the money which bought the of would have to have been the pieces of silver course he got the pieces of silver that night as and thus have spent that Oh I believe that the house of cards is comming Maybe we should at this discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about By the as to where the prophesy of the field came from the mention of it in you when we are done with this study on his remind me to discuss this with I am
