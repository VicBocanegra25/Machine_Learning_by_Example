Repository to store my versions of the code from the book Python Machine Learning by Example from Hayden Liu (2020) - Packt. 

## Contents:
Currently, we've implemeneted a couple of algorithms for Supervised Learning (Mostly Classification problems): 
1. Na√Øve Bayes Classifier - Heart Disease 
2. Support Vector Machines - Face Recognition
3. Decision Trees, Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees - Ad Click-Through prediction
4. Logistic Regression - Ads
